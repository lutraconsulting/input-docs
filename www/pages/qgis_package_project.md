To work with Input, you need to create a self contained folder with all your files. If you work with several data sources spread across multiple folders/drives, it is recommended to create a self-contained folder with all the layers and data.

For packaging an existing project, visit [Mergin plugin for QGIS](https://help.cloudmergin.com/plugin-new-project). The Mergin plugin offers you a project wizard to easily package and upload your data to the Mergin server in a few steps.
