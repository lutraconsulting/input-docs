# Vector tiles

Vector tiles are a better alternative for cartography maps as background data. It is lighter in size, flexible styling and your maps are not pixelated.

## Online services

There are several online services. For example you can add ESRI Basemap vector tile (QGIS 3.16+):

- In QGIS, from the **Browser panel** right-click on **Vector Tiles**
- Select **New Generic Connection**
- A new window will appear:
    - For **Name** type: **ESRI Basemap**
    - For **URL** type: **https://basemaps.arcgis.com/v1/arcgis/rest/services/World_Basemap/VectorTileServer/tile/{z}/{y}/{x}.pbf**
    - Set **Min. Zoom Level** to **0**
    - Set **Max. Zoom Level** to **14**
    - For **Style URL** type: **https://basemaps.arcgis.com/b2/arcgis/rest/services/World_Basemap/VectorTileServer/resources/styles/root.json**

Another source of online vector tiles are Qwant maps:
- In QGIS, from the **Browser panel** right-click on **Vector Tiles**
- Select **New Generic Connection**
- A new window will appear:
    - For **Name** type: **Qwant map**
    - For **URL** type: **https://www.qwant.com/maps/tiles/ozbasemap/{z}/{x}/{y}.pbf**
    - Set **Min. Zoom Level** to **0**
    - Set **Max. Zoom Level** to **14**
    - For **Style URL** type: **https://raw.githubusercontent.com/QwantResearch/qwant-basic-gl-style/master/style.json**


## Generating vector tiles for offline use
In QGIS (3.14+), you can generate your own vector tiles. Alternatively, you can generate vector tiles using OpenMapTiles from OpenStreetMap data.

In the example below, we walk through steps to generate a vector tile using OpenMapTiles for [Limpopo](https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/349547#map=7/-24.367/29.982)

Note that instructions below requires familiarity with terminal. In addition your operating system should support **docker**.


  - Clone the OpenMapTiles repository: `git clone git@github.com:openmaptiles/openmaptiles.git`

  - Download osm.pbf file for the country or region where your area falls in from [here](https://download.geofabrik.de/).

  - Search for your area of interest and find the OSM relation ID (from [here](https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/) using method described [here](https://github.com/JamesChevalier/cities#how-to-get-the-poly-file-for-a-specific-city)  or alternatively download it [from this git repository](https://github.com/JamesChevalier/) if available).

  - Clip the *osm.pbf* downloaded in step 2 using the poly downloaded in step 3:

  `osmconvert south-africa.osm.pbf -B=limpopo.poly --complete-ways --complete-multipolygons -o=my.osm.pbf`

  - Place *my.osm.pbf* under *openmaptiles/data/*

  - Run `./quickstart.sh my` from *openmaptiles/* folder (where you cloned your repository): this will generate the tiles with the default settings (i.e. low zoom level of max=7)

  - Edit openmaptiles/data/my.dc-config.yml and change the Max_Zoom to 14

  - Re-run `./quickstart.sh my`

  - The above process should produce an mbtiles for your clipped OSM file

  - You can load the file and style it using one of the [OpenMapTiles styles](https://github.com/openmaptiles/osm-bright-gl-style)
