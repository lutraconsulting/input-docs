You can search for the content of your attribute data from Input. Input is also capable of **split search**: searching values from multiple fields.

# QGIS project configuration

To be able to search the attribute table of a layer, you need to first configure your [QGIS project](https://docs.qgis.org/3.10/en/docs/user_manual/introduction/qgis_configuration.html?highlight=properties#data-sources-properties):

- Open QGIS Desktop with you QGIS Project
- In the Menu > Project > Properties click on "Data Sources"
![browse_enable](../images/qgis_data_sources.png)
- Under **Searchable** column, select the layers you'd like to search

# Search attribute data in Input

To search for a record, you first need to [open the attribute table](/howto/browse_data.html). You can then type in the string and Input should shortlist the matching records.

Selecting an individual record, Input will open the form related to the feature.
