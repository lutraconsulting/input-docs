We're almost ready to start surveying - we just need to get the project onto 
our device.

* Open Input and press *My projects*

![My projects in Input](../images/my-projects.png)

You should now see the new project we just created. If you see a Mergin 
login prompt, enter your Mergin account details to login then go to *My projects*.

* Press the download button

The project should now be shown with a check mark:

![Synced Mergin Project with Check Mark](../images/project-with-check-mark.png)

At this stage you can open the project from *Home* and start adding notes 
and map features. In the next section we'll see how to push changes back 
to Mergin.
