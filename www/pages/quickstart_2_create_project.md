The easiest way to create a new project is from a template.

The *Field Notes* template comes with simple background mapping and allows 
you to create points, lines and areas with field notes and photos:

## Create a free Mergin account

You can carry out these steps from your mobile or desktop web browser - 
either will be OK.

* Go to the <a href="https://public.cloudmergin.com/" target=_blank>Mergin 
website</a> and create a new account.


## Create a project

You should now be logged-in to Mergin. 

* Create a new project using the button shown below:

![Create a Mergin Project](../images/create-mergin-project.png)

* Set *Template project* to *Field notes*
* Give the project a name

![Create a Mergin Project from a Template](../images/create-mergin-project-from-template.png)

Your namespace will look different to that shown in the example above. 

* Press *CREATE* to create the project

The project has now been created on Mergin. The next step is to get it onto 
our device.
