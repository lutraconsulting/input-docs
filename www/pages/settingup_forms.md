**Note**: You can follow the examples in this section using [this project](https://public.cloudmergin.com/projects/documentation/form_setup/tree).

When capturing geo-data, it is often required to fill in a form related to the surveyed point, line or area. The forms set up can simplifying filling the data and can also ensure the correct information is populated.

Input supports a number of form types:
- Drop-down options
- Slider
- Date and Time
- Checkbox
- Photos
- Drill-down (or cascade) forms

In addition, the following configurations can be applied to form or fields:
- Default value
- Derived value
- Groups
- Constraints
- Conditional visibility of field/group

Setting up forms can be configured using [QGIS widget types](https://docs.qgis.org/3.16/en/docs/user_manual/working_with_vector/vector_properties.html#edit-widgets).

In the sections below, we go through examples of setting up different widgets for forms in QGIS and Input:

- [Photos](/howto/settingup_forms_photos)
- [Date and time](/howto/settingup_forms_datetime)
- [Checkbox](/howto/settingup_forms_checkbox)
- [Slider](/howto/settingup_forms_slider)
