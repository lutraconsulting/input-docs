**Note**: You can follow the examples in this section using [this project](https://public.cloudmergin.com/projects/documentation/form_setup/tree).

When capturing geo-data, it is often required to fill in a form related to the surveyed point, line or area. The forms set up can simplifying filling the data and can also ensure the correct information is populated.

Input supports a number of edit widget types for forms such as: drop-down options, slider, date and time, checkbox, photos. In addition, extra configuration can be done to the fields and form layout, for example: setting a default value, conditional visibility and constrains.

Setting up forms can be configured using [QGIS widget types](https://docs.qgis.org/3.16/en/docs/user_manual/working_with_vector/vector_properties.html#edit-widgets).
