[Kartoza](https://kartoza.com/en/) were commissioned to undertake a survey to assess water access in villages located in Waterberg District, in the Limpopo province, South Africa. In order to know which villages in the district need more attention in terms of accessing water. The main challenge of the study was internet connection, because most areas are remote the syncing of recorded data through Input was a bit of a struggle for the surveyors. Another issue was the conflicting files that were created whenever surveyors had to sync their information. The outcome of the results was used for [analysis](http://wbr.kartoza.com:3000).

During the survey, 5 surveyors collected spatial and other information over a period of a month. The network availability was extremely poor in the Villages and hence, synchronizations took place after the work in the site office.
