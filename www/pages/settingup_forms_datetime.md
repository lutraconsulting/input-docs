If you want to record time and date when you capture the feature, you need to make sure you have a field with **Date** or **Date and Time** type present in your survey layer. Note that all GIS data formats support these types of field. It is assumed, you use Geopackage layer, hence this field type is supported.

## QGIS

To set up a data and time widget:

  - Download and open [this example project](https://public.cloudmergin.com/projects/documentation/form_setup/tree) in QGIS
  - From the layer panel, right-click on **survey** layer and select **Properties**
  - In the new window, select **Attributes form**

  - Select **DateTime** field under the right column (**Available Widgets**)
  - Under the **Widget Display**, from **Widget Type** section:
    - From the drop-down menu, select **Date/Time**
    - Under **Widget Display**, select **Calendar popup**
  - Under **Defaults**, type **now()**

By setting the default value to **now()**, it will assign the date and time when the feature is captured.

Ensure to save and synchronise your project.

- Open Input on your device and from **Projects** > **Explore** download **documentation\form_setup**
