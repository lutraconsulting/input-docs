# Quick Start

Input is a simple survey app allowing users to capture data in field.
Forms and data preparation can be done in QGIS software.

Input is not aimed to be a full GIS/mapping application. It is designed
with simplicity, ease of use and seamless data synchronisation in mind.

A typical workflow for using Input consists of the following steps:

-   Preparing project: user loads background and survey layers, set up the forms, apply styling to the layers, set up map themes and define the layers to be used for survey purpose. See [Project preparation](howto/project_config)

-   Data/project transfer: once the project set up, users need to transfer data to the device. This can be achieved through [Mergin](https://public.cloudmergin.com). See [Data transfer](howto/data_sync)

-   Working with Input: map navigation, data editing, including filling the forms, viewing existing data and uploading the changes back to Mergin. See [Using Input](using_input)

-   Input user interface: describes various buttons, options and configurations. See [Input user interface](input_ui)
